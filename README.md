## 1. About

A CSS userstyle with custom CSS code, designed for improving collaboration with the [dynalist.io](https://dynalist.io/)  
software. This custom CSS style overides the default Dynalist CSS styling with our own.

This stylesheet is made for collaboration on the [Edgeryders](https://edgeryders.eu) platform, built around some internal 
conventions for tag naming etc. as documented in [our Dynalist manual](https://edgeryders.eu/t/7618). You are free to 
modify it, of course.


## 2. Installation

This CSS userstyle (in its newest version) is also publised at [userstyles.org/styles/151455](https://userstyles.org/styles/151455). So the simplest way to install it is as follows:

1. Install the [Stylus browser extension](https://add0n.com/stylus.html), by following the download link for your browser there.

2. Visit [this userstyle on userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/styles/151455).

3. Click "Install with Stylus", then "Install style" in the popup window that will appear.

4. Visit one of your Dynalist lists, and you should see the changes already.

5. Open the Stylus menu (click the "**S**" button in the browser toolbar).

6. Optional: highlight your own tasks and @mentions. (You will have to repeat this step after updating the "Edgeryders Dynalist" userstyle, as updates will overwrite your changes.)

    1. Click the pen icon next to where it says "Edgeryders Dynalist".
    2. In the edit window, scroll to section `/* EDIT HERE TO HIGHLIGHT YOUR OWN STUFF */`
    3. In this section, replace `#username` with `#` followed by your name / username. What name to use depends on the convention you will establish in your group of collaborators.
  
Note that you can turn the userstyle off and on again any time in the Stylus menu, without disabling it.
